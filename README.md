# Emoji
Simple, cute and useless language compiler &lt;3

## Usage

For now you need to change the file name in main, run it and it will generate for you nice, ugly and working JavaScript code :)

### Arithmetic operators

```
✿     ADD
❤     SUB
✰     MULT
๑     DIV
{     (
}     )
```

For example: 
12 - (3 + 4) / 7 * 3
would be:
```
12 ❤ {3 ✿ 4} ๑ 7 ✰ 3
```
### Strings

You can create a string like this:
```
☆º°˚*☆ Have a magical day ☆º°˚*☆
```

### Asignment

You can assing integers, doubles and strings to variables. Names must consist of letters (uppercase or lowercase).
Examples:
```
dog ＼(＾▽＾)／ 7                               dog = 7
cat ＼(＾▽＾)／ dog ✰ 8                         cat = dog * 8
FRIENDSHIP ＼(＾▽＾)／ ☆º°˚*☆ Magic ☆º°˚*☆      FRIENDSHIP = "Magic"
```


### Comments

You comment a whole line like this:
```
(☯‿├┬┴┬┴ I'm hidden <3
```

### Logical operators
Look at the eyes!
```
ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ       ==
ʕₒᴥₒʔ       <
ʕ'ᴥ'ʔ       >
```
You can compare variables, numbers and arithmetic expressions. For example

```
cat ʕₒᴥₒʔ 32 ❤ dog        cat < 32 - dog 
15 ʕ'ᴥ'ʔ 7 ๑ 2            15 > 7 / 2
```


### Printing
Of course we can print stuff too! You can print variables, arithmetic expressions and strings!
Example:
```
( . .)φ 2.5 ✰ 7.1
( . .)φ ☆º°˚*☆ Live in harmony ☆º°˚*☆
( . .)φ cat
```

### If statements
If statements consist of: "if" keyword, condition, "then" keyword, body, "end if" keyword. In our language these are:

```
(•ิ_•ิ)? cat ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ dog                                          IF cat == dog
ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ                                                      THEN

    ( . .)φ  ☆º°˚*☆ Cats and dogs are equal. ☆º°˚*☆             print "Cats and dogs are equal."

¯\_(ツ)_/¯                                                    END IF
```
Very intuitive!

### While loop
As in most of languages in while loop you have: "while" keyword, condition, "do" keyword, body and "end while" keyword.
```
<(_ _<(_ _<(_  dog ʕ'ᴥ'ʔ 4  _)>_ _)>_ _)>         WHILE dog > 4 DO

    dog ＼(＾▽＾)／ dog ❤ 1                             dog = dog - 1

ʢᵕᴗᵕʡ                                             END WHILE
```
