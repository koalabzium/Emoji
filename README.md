### Arithmetic operators

```
✿     ADD
❤     SUB
✰     MULT
๑     DIV
{     (
}     )
```

For example: 
12 - (3 + 4) / 7 * 3
would be:
```
12 ❤ {3 ✿ 4} ๑ 7 ✰ 3
```
### Strings

You create string like this:
```
☆º°˚*☆ Have a magical day ☆º°˚*☆
```

### Asignment

You can assing integers, doubles and strings to variables. Names must consist of letters (uppercase or lowercase).
Examples:
```
dog ＼(＾▽＾)／ 7                         dog = 7
cat ＼(＾▽＾)／ dog ✰ 8                   cat = dog * 8
LOVE ＼(＾▽＾)／ ☆º°˚*☆ Magic ☆º°˚*☆      LOVE = "Magic"
```


### Comments

You comment whole line like this:
```
(☯‿├┬┴┬┴ I'm hidden <3
```

### Logical operators
Look at the eyes!
```
ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ       ==
ʕₒᴥₒʔ       <
ʕ'ᴥ'ʔ       >
```
You can compare variables to variables, variables to numbers and variables to arithmetic expressions. For example
cat > 32 - dog 
```
cat ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ 32 ❤ dog
```



### Printing
Of course we can print stuff too! You can print variables, arithmetic expressions, logical expressions and strings!
Example:
